https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

##Modifications to This Script

To run this script you will have to change the working directory to wherever you have save the unzipped version of the original UCI HAR Dataset.
This script creates a tidy data set that contains the means of all features per test subject and per activity.
